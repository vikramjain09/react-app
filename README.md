### `The rules of the game are as follows:`
●	Move one marble over exactly one other marble either horizontally or vertically onto an empty space, no diagonal moves. A move is made by clicking/dragging a source marble and clicking/dropping to an empty place.
●	A legal move clears the marble you jumped over. O-O-X becomes X-X-O (O is marble and X is an empty place). 
●	Continue moving one marble over the other till no other moves are left.
